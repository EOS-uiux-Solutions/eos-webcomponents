# EOS-webcomponents

The web components library for EOS

## How to run

First install Polymer (I would suggest globally) `npm install -g polymer-cli` then install the dependecies with `npm i`.  
Now you can run `polymer serve` for dev env (click on reusable components: http://127.0.0.1:8081/components/eos-webcomponents/)
